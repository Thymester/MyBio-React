      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Thymester, a passionate programmer and developer with a love for creating
        innovative and practical solutions. My favorite languages are JavaScript and C#,
        and I prefer working with React and Flask for building web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, you can often find me experimenting with new technologies,
        contributing to open-source projects, and working on personal coding projects.
